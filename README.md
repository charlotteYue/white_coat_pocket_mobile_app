# White Coat Pocket Guide Mobile App 

## Project Description
<!-- you can include known bugs, design decisions, external references used... -->
> build up with React Native framework and could run in both Android and iOS

## Getting Started
We are looking forward to you trying out our app!
If you use Android devices, we have an apk packed for you. You can find it in the root of this repo named
`WCPG.apk`.
If you use iPhone, unfortunately, as we don't have Apple Developer Program for now (which costs $99 :-<) you 
would have to run this app using React Native using the emulator of your local computer (which has 
to be a Mac). Consult this page for help: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

1. First clone this repo to your local machine
2. Install XCode properly
3. Install Node and Watchman using Homebrew
    ```
    brew install node
    brew install watchman
    ```
4. Install an iOS Simulator in XCode

    To install a simulator, open Xcode > Preferences... and select the Components tab. 
    Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.
5. Install CocoaPods
    ```
   sudo gem install cocoapods
    ```
6. Run `npm install` at the project root folder
7. Run `npx react-native run-ios` at the project root folder

And it should start running using iOS simulator!
